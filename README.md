## Tips
Learn about time management, resource management and importance have good friends close to you.

And a little bit more about pointers, pointer to pointers, file descriptors, READ, OPEN, buffer, how to define a variable during compilation.

Also good to focus in minimize lines of functions and how to use fsanitize and gdb. 

Good to know to don't trust codes/testers from other people and start making your own.
